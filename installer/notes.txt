Before builing using install4, do the following:

1) mvn clean package

This will build a new jar for phylosketch app

Optionally, if the pom.xml has changed:

2) mvn dependency:copy-dependencies

This will copy all required jars to target/dependency

Then remove all jars that have javafx in their name.

Then run the install4j build.
